# Language Modelling

## Installation
To build this project you will need to have installed *Maven* and the *Java
Development Kit*.

Expand this project to its destination folder. Open a terminal or command prompt
session in this `tongue-form` directory. Run:
```
mvn package
```

This has been tested on multiple devices, and should complete with no issue.

## Running the program

Once built, assuming you are in the `tongue-form` directory, you may run the
program with the following command:
```
java -jar target/tongue-form.jar -i training.txt -t test.txt -o output.txt
```
